# react-component-testing

- simple component
- ‎with prop
- ‎with branching logic
- ‎with simple dependency
- ‎with named export
- ‎with lib that is hard to mock

## Ideas

- separation of visual and data
- ‎have just one render function
- set props in tests
- mock all dependencies
- use automocks for deps that are hard to mock
- rely on libraries to be the glue
- use enzyme for interaction testing
